## Preparing Data

Create a file named `.env`, fill it with the app's password:

```
PASSWORD=<app password>
```

Export Zahi's Excel as CSV, save it as `data.csv`, then run:

```sh
node index.js
```

That will create a file named `data.js`, you can now delete the `data.csv` file.

## Deploy

```sh
git push
```
